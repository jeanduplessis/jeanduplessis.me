        <h2>README</h2>
        <p>
          If I&apos;m your manager or colleague, the information in this section will
          help you understand how I do things and how best to work with me.
        </p>
        <h3>Management style</h3>
        <p>
          Work-wise I’m mostly a hands-off manager. I believe in hiring{" "}
          <strong>smart people</strong>, setting{" "}
          <strong>clear expectations</strong>, and then{" "}
          <strong>holding people accountable</strong>. That said, I am always
          happy to get involved in the work when you need me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I place a lot of emphasis on career development and personal growth
          with my direct reports. I believe if you are engaged and growing, not
          only will you be happy, but the team will benefit from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use the{" "}

            CliftonStrengths assessment
          </a>{" "}
          to better understand your unique strengths to help create the
          opportunities for you to utilize them.
        </p>
        <h3>1-1s</h3>
        <p>I do weekly 1-1s with my direct reports.</p>
        <h3>Skip-level meetings</h3>
        <p>
          I do skip-level meetings with all my indirect reports once a month.
        </p>
        <h3>Getting to know you</h3>
        <p>
          If I am your new manager, I will ask you to schedule a series of three
          60 minute 1-1s (1 per week, in addition to our regular 1-1) to learn
          more about you.
        </p>
        <p>Here are the topics for the sessions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Tell me about your life starting from grade school - include
            whatever you deem important to you.
          </li>
          <li>What do you want to do at the pinnacle of your career?</li>
          <li>
            I will reflect back on things I heard and tell you about how I can
            help you achieve your goals and be successful.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Feedback</h3>

          you want me to know about, please don’t hesitate to contact me
          directly. Send me a message via email, Slack or schedule a time for us
          to video chat.

        <p>
          If you are my report, you can expect me to regularly give you positive
          and constructive improvement feedback. I aim to praise my reports in
          public (Slack channels, team sync/retrospective meetings). Still,
          constructive improvement feedback will always be in private.
