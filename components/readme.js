        <h2>README</h2>
        <p>
          If I&apos;m your manager or colleague, the information in this section
          will help you understand how I approach things and how best to work
          with me.
        </p>

        <h3>Management style</h3>

        <p>
          I don&apos;t have a one size fits all approach to managing my reports.
          I believe that as humans we are all unique and have different
          strengths and and preferences. I work to understand my reports and how
          to get the best out of each of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          My baseline approach to management is to{" "}
          <strong>hire smart people</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>set clear expectations</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>offer my collaboration</strong> and then{" "}
          <strong>hold you accountable</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Work-wise I&apos;m mostly a hands-off manager, however, I am always
          happy to get involved in the work when you need me. I will only
          intervene if I deem the direction you are going in to be deterimental
          to the goals of the team or business.
        </p>

        <p>
          I place a lot of emphasis on <strong>career development</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>personal growth</strong> with my direct reports. I believe
          that part of being engaged and fulfilled at work requires people to be
          growing. Not only will you then be happy, but the team will benefit
          from it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I use the{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths"
            target="_blank"

          >
            CliftonStrengths assessment
          </a>{" "}
          to better understand your unique strengths to help create the
          opportunities for you to utilize them.
        </p>

        <h4>Trust</h4>
        <p>
          Trust is the single most important component in my management
          approach.
        </p>

        <p>
          As my report I implicitly give you my trust from day one. I don&apos;t
          expect you to do the same. I recognize that there is a power imbalance
          in our relationship and that it is my responsibility to earn your
          trust. I aim to achieve this by showing you that I care about you as a
          person, your ambitions, keeping my commitments and being consistent.
        </p>

        {/* ----- GETTING TO KNOW YOU ----- */}

        <h3>Getting to know you</h3>

        <p>
          If I am your new manager, in addition to our regular 1-1s, I will go
          through a series of four steps to learn more about you.
        </p>
        <p>These steps are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Understanding your strengths.</strong>
            <br />I will ask you to complete a{" "}
            <a
              href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"
            >
              CliftonStrengths assessment.
            </a>
            <br />
            This gives me insight into your unique strengths.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tell me about the story of your life.</strong>
            <br />
            Starting from grade school, include whatever you deem important and
            comes to mind that you are comfortable to share with me.
            <br />
            This helps me understand who you are, your history, and what is
            important to you in life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What work environment fulfills you.</strong>
            <br />
            I ask you to imagine that your partner tells you they&apos;ve never
            seen you as engaged, motivated and happy at work.
            <br />I then ask you to explain to me what your work environment
            needs to look like for this to be true?
            <br />
            This gives me insight into how to get you to feel fulfilled at work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reflecting back to you</strong>
            <br />I will reflect back on all the things you shared with me and
            how I interpret it.
            <br />
            This is to ensure that I understood you correctly
            <br />I also share with you how I believe I can set you up for
            success in your role and help you be fulfilled at work.
          </li>
        </ol>

        {/* ----- 1-1s ----- */}

        <h3>1-1s</h3>
        <p>I do weekly 1-1s with my direct reports.</p>

        <p>
          This time is my commitment to you and I aim to preserve this time at
          all cost.
          <br />
          It is your opportunity to raise any topics with me that are top of
          mind for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don&apos;t rely on these sessions for status updates on work,
          however, if discussing a particular work project is important to you
          I&apos;ll hapilly engage.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will have a shared document we use to capture notes and set agenda
          items async. I will add topics that I&apos;d like to discuss in the
          lead up to the session to the agenda. I encourage you to do the same.
        </p>

        <h4>Growth log</h4>

        <p>
          Separate to our 1-1 doc, but very much a feature in our 1-1
          conversations is your growth log.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is simply a document where I ask you to capture all the
          accomplishments you are proud of whether they are big or small. It is
          similar in nature to the{" "}
          <a
            href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/"

          >
            brag document
          </a>{" "}
          that Julia Evans blogged about. It is just a simplied timestamped
          version and I refrain from using the word &ldquo;brag&rdquo; since
          some people struggle with this.
        </p>

        <p>
          I will contribute to this document when I observe you doing things
          that I felt you excelled at. I will also add feedback, both positive
          and constructive, to this document.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why do all this you might ask? As your manager I will only ever
          observe a small amount of your interactions and achievements. I want
          to ensure I have the full picture of your impact so that I can be an
          effective advocate for you when I represent you during performance
          reviews.
        </p>

        {/* ----- SKIP-LEVEL MEETINGS ----- */}

        <h3>Skip-level meetings</h3>
        <p>
          I do skip-level meetings with all my indirect reports once a month.
        </p>
        <p>The goal of these meetings are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Connect with the team member and learn more about them.</li>
          <li>
            Understand the challenges they and their team might be facing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Give context to questions they might have around happenings in the
            business.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          I view skip-level meetings as an invaluable activity to ensure I keep
          my finger on the pulse of what happens day-to-day, understand the
          challenges faces and to gather feedback I can give to my managers.
        </p>

        <p>
          This also helps me avoid recency bias and ensure I don&apos;t forget
          anything.
        </p>

        {/* ----- FEEDBACK ----- */}

        <h3>Feedback</h3>

        <p>Feedback is one of life&apos;s greatest gifts.</p>

        <h4>For me</h4>
        <p>
          First I want you to understand that I really value feedback and it is
          one of the highest forms of respect you can show me. You don&apos;t
          have to be concerned with how you deliver it. Raw unfiltered feedback is
          totally fine and I will assume positive intent from your side.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you therefor have any feedback, questions, concerns, or anything else that
          you want me to know about, please don&apos;t hesitate to contact me
          directly. Send me a message via email, Slack or schedule a time for us
          to video chat (my preference).
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h4>For you</h4>
        <p>
          If you are my report, you can expect me to regularly give you positive
          and constructive improvement feedback. I aim to praise my reports in
          public (Slack channels, team sync/retrospective meetings). Still,
          constructive improvement feedback will always be in private.
