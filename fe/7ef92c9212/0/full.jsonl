very simple component structure\n\n**Utility Functions**: \n- Email obfuscation in Contact component\n- Phone number formatting display\n\n**Shared Types**: None - JavaScript, no TypeScript\n\n**Image Optimization**:\n- Next.js Image component with priority loading on critical images\n- WebP format with proper alt text\n- Responsive sizing\n\n**Responsive Design**:\n- Tailwind breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:)\n- Mobile-first approach in header component\n- Different layouts for mobile vs desktop\n\n**Accessibility**:\n- Semantic HTML (section, article, nav)\n- ARIA labels (role=\"list\", aria-hidden)\n- Proper link rel attributes (noreferrer, noopener)\n- Image alt text throughout\n- Skip links implicitly supported via anchor navigation\n\n**Security Headers** (from next.config.js):\n- Content-Security-Policy configured\n- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\n- DNS prefetch enabled\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is a **lightweight, single-page portfolio website** built with modern Next.js. It's a personal brand/resume site showcasing Jean du Plessis as an engineering leader. The architecture is straightforward:\n- No backend API routes\n- No database\n- No complex state management\n- Responsive, accessible design\n- Optimized images with Vercel integrations\n- Clean separation of concerns with component-based structure\n- Minimal dependencies (focused on the essentials)\n\nThe project recently updated to Latest versions (Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind 4) and integrated Vercel's performance monitoring tools. It uses modern tooling (ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier) for code quality."}],"totalDurationMs":91250,"totalTokens":86605,"totalToolUseCount":39,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1081,"cache_read_input_tokens":83708,"output_tokens":1810,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1081,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"93a0549d-4367-4564-8c38-5fedab1a510d"}

See [references/quality-criteria.md](references/quality-criteria.md) for detailed rubrics.\n\n**Quick Assessment Checklist:**\n\n| Criterion | Weight | Check |\n|-----------|--------|-------|\n| Commands/workflows documented | High | Are build/test/deploy commands present? |\n| Architecture clarity | High | Can Claude understand the codebase structure? |\n| Non-obvious patterns | Medium | Are gotchas and quirks documented? |\n| Conciseness | Medium | No verbose explanations or obvious info? |\n| Currency | High | Does it reflect current codebase state? |\n| Actionability | High | Are instructions executable, not vague? |\n\n**Quality Scores:**\n- **A (90-100)**: Comprehensive, current, actionable\n- **B (70-89)**: Good coverage, minor gaps\n- **C (50-69)**: Basic info, missing key sections\n- **D (30-49)**: Sparse or outdated\n- **F (0-29)**: Missing or severely outdated\n\n### Phase 3: Quality Report Output\n\n**ALWAYS output the quality report BEFORE making any updates.**\n\nFormat:\n\n```\n## CLAUDE.md Quality Report\n\n### Summary\n- Files found: X\n- Average score: X/100\n- Files needing update: X\n\n### File-by-File Assessment\n\n#### 1. ./CLAUDE.md (Project Root)\n**Score: XX/100 (Grade: X)**\n\n| Criterion | Score | Notes |\n|-----------|-------|-------|\n| Commands/workflows | X/20 | ... |\n| Architecture clarity | X/20 | ... |\n| Non-obvious patterns | X/15 | ... |\n| Conciseness | X/15 | ... |\n| Currency | X/15 | ... |\n| Actionability | X/15 | ... |\n\n**Issues:**\n- [List specific problems]\n\n**Recommended additions:**\n- [List what should be added]\n\n#### 2. ./packages/api/CLAUDE.md (Package-specific)\n...\n```\n\n### Phase 4: Targeted Updates\n\nAfter outputting the quality report, ask user for confirmation before updating.\n\n**Update Guidelines (Critical):**\n\n1. **Propose targeted additions only** - Focus on genuinely useful info:\n   - Commands or workflows discovered during analysis\n   - Gotchas or non-obvious patterns found in code\n   - Package relationships that weren't clear\n   - Testing approaches that work\n   - Configuration quirks\n\n2. **Keep it minimal** - Avoid:\n   - Restating what's obvious from the code\n   - Generic best practices already covered\n   - One-off fixes unlikely to recur\n   - Verbose explanations when a one-liner suffices\n\n3. **Show diffs** - For each change, show:\n   - Which CLAUDE.md file to update\n   - The specific addition (as a diff or quoted block)\n   - Brief explanation of why this helps future sessions\n\n**Diff Format:**\n\n```markdown\n### Update: ./CLAUDE.md\n\n**Why:** Build command was missing, causing confusion about how to run the project.\n\n```diff\n+ ## Quick Start\n+\n+ ```bash\n+ npm install\n+ npm run dev  # Start development server on port 3000\n+ ```\n```\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Apply Updates\n\nAfter user approval, apply changes using the Edit tool. Preserve existing content structure.\n\n## Templates\n\nSee [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for CLAUDE.md templates by project type.\n\n## Common Issues to Flag\n\n1. **Stale commands**: Build commands that no longer work\n2. **Missing dependencies**: Required tools not mentioned\n3. **Outdated architecture**: File structure that's changed\n4. **Missing environment setup**: Required env vars or config\n5. **Broken test commands**: Test scripts that have changed\n6. **Undocumented gotchas**: Non-obvious patterns not captured\n\n## User Tips to Share\n\nWhen presenting recommendations, remind users:\n\n- **`#` key shortcut**: During a Claude session, press `#` to have Claude auto-incorporate learnings into CLAUDE.md\n- **Keep it concise**: CLAUDE.md should be human-readable; dense is better than verbose\n- **Actionable commands**: All documented commands should be copy-paste ready\n- **Use `.claude.local.md`**: For personal preferences not shared with team (add to `.gitignore`)\n- **Global defaults**: Put user-wide preferences in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`\n\n## What Makes a Great CLAUDE.md\n\n**Key principles:**\n- Concise and human-readable\n- Actionable commands that can be copy-pasted\n- Project-specific patterns, not generic advice\n- Non-obvious gotchas and warnings\n\n**Recommended sections** (use only what's relevant):\n- Commands (build, test, dev, lint)\n- Architecture (directory structure)\n- Key Files (entry points, config)\n- Code Style (project conventions)\n- Environment (required vars, setup)\n- Testing (commands, patterns)\n- Gotchas (quirks, common mistakes)\n- Workflow (when to do what)\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"c72a5378-fdad-4205-b90d-9c5d59b2b0b3","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:19:47.268Z"}

Now I have a complete picture. Let me compile my comprehensive audit report.\n\n## CLAUDE.md Audit Report\n\nI've conducted a thorough audit of your codebase. Here's what I found:\n\n### 1. Commands Verification ✓\nAll documented commands are accurate:\n- `npm run dev` → runs `next dev`\n- `npm run build` → runs `next build && next-sitemap`\n- `npm run start` → runs `next start`\n- `npm run lint` → runs `eslint .`\n\nAll scripts match the documentation perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Gotchas & Non-Obvious Patterns\n\n#### next.config.js\n**Security Headers (lines 1-15):**\n- CSP includes `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` — should be documented as this is permissive\n- CSP allows `vitals.vercel-insights.com` (needed for Vercel Speed Insights)\n- CSP allows `fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com` (Google Fonts usage)\n\n**Image Configuration:**\n- `dangerouslyAllowSVG: true` is enabled — SVGs are allowed (used in footer for Creative Commons logos)\n- Remote patterns allow `mirrors.creativecommons.org` with wildcard pathname\n- Formats: AVIF and WebP enabled (good for optimization)\n\n#### tailwind.config.js\n**Custom Font Family Extensions:**\n- Sans: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial\n- Serif: Roboto Slab (not standard serif font)\n- Mono: Roboto Mono\n- Custom letter-spacing: `widest: \"0.25em\"`\n- Typography plugin enabled\n\n#### eslint.config.mjs\n- Uses modern flat config format (ESM)\n- Only includes Next.js core-web-vitals rules, no custom rules\n- Very minimal configuration\n\n#### stylelint.config.mjs\n- Enforces idiomatic CSS property order\n- Integrates Prettier formatting (`prettier/prettier: true`)\n- Uses `stylelint-order` plugin\n\n#### postcss.config.mjs\n- Only uses `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin (Tailwind CSS 4)\n- No autoprefixer config shown, but autoprefixer is in devDependencies\n\n---\n\n### 3. Path Aliases\n**NO jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json found** — the project uses relative imports throughout (e.g., `import Header from \"../components/header\"`). This is not documented in CLAUDE.md, but it's consistent with the \"simple, minimal\" architecture.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Architecture Verification\n\n#### Pages Directory ✓\n- `pages/_app.js` ✓ (layout wrapper)\n- `pages/_document.js` ✓ (custom document)\n- `pages/index.js` ✓ (home page)\n- `pages/404.js` ✓ (error page)\n\n#### Components Directory ✓\nAll documented components present:\n- `about.js` ✓\n- `career.js` ✓\n- `contact.js` ✓\n- `content-section.js` ✓\n- `footer.js` ✓\n- `header.js` ✓\n- `personal.js` ✓ (This is unused - only imported as empty stub)\n- `readme.js` ✓\n\n#### Styles Directory ✓\n- `global.css` ✓ (minimal: just `@import \"tailwindcss\"` + scroll-behavior)\n- `content-section.module.css` ✓ (CSS modules for styling content sections with custom heading markers like ##, ###, ####)\n\n#### Analytics Location\n**CORRECT:** Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights are in `_document.js` (lines 2, 3, 48, 49), not `_app.js`. Documentation is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Testing Setup\n**NO testing framework found** — No jest.config, vitest.config, cypress.config, or playwright.config files. Not mentioned in CLAUDE.md, and there's no `/test` or `/tests` directory. This is worth noting if testing is ever needed.\n\n---\n\n### 6. CI/CD Configuration\n**NO .github/workflows directory** — No GitHub Actions workflows found. Not documented. Site is deployed to Vercel (Vercel's native integration would handle CI/CD).\n\n---\n\n### 7. Environment Variables\n\n**Found:**\n- `process.env.SITE_URL` in `next-sitemap.config.js` (line 2)\n  - Default: `'https://jeanduplessis.me'`\n  - This allows override via environment variable during build\n\n**NOT documented in CLAUDE.md** — You might want to add a note about this for production deployments.\n\nNo other `process.env` usage found in the codebase (outside of node_modules).\n\n---\n\n### 8. next-sitemap Configuration\n```javascript\n{\n  siteUrl: process.env.SITE_URL || 'https://jeanduplessis.me',\n  generateRobotsTxt: true,\n}\n```\n\n**Non-obvious settings:**\n- Very minimal config, relying on defaults\n- Generates `robots.txt` automatically\n- Creates `sitemap.xml` and `sitemap-0.xml` in `/public`\n- Base URL can be overridden via `SITE_URL` env var\n\n---\n\n### 9. content-section Component\n**Behavior:** Simple wrapper component:\n```javascript\nexport default function ContentSection({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className={styles[\"content-section\"]}>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nHowever, **the CSS module is NOT simple:**\n- Applies extensive styling to headings with `::before` pseudo-elements (## ### #### markers)\n- Custom typography for h2, h3, h4 with specific margins and colors\n- Restrictive max-width on paragraphs (80ch)\n- Custom pre and small text styling\n- Top border separator between sections\n- This is a styled wrapper that enforces markdown-like heading markers\n\n---\n\n### Issues & Missing Documentation\n\n1. **Environment Variables**: `SITE_URL` env var for next-sitemap is not documented\n2. **Permissive CSP**: Security headers with `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` are not explained\n3. **Personal Component**: Exists but is unused (only exports empty stub)\n4. **No prettier config file**: Package.json shows `prettier` dependency, but no `.prettierrc` found. Stylelint integrates it via plugin, but there's no explicit prettier configuration\n5. **Missing .env.example**: No environment setup documentation (though only `SITE_URL` is used)\n6. **No TypeScript note**: CLAUDE.md says \"No TypeScript\" but this could be clearer about what this means for IDE support\n7. **Autoprefixer**: In devDependencies but not explicitly configured in postcss.config.mjs\n\n---\n\n### What's Accurate in CLAUDE.md ✓\n- All commands documented correctly\n- Architecture description is accurate\n- Security headers mention is correct\n- Sitemap configuration explanation is accurate\n- Vercel deployment and analytics placement are correct\n- Component list is mostly accurate (minus unused personal.js)\n- Styling description is accurate\n\n### Recommendations for CLAUDE.md Updates\n\n1. Add environment variable section:\n   ```\n   ## Environment Variables\n   - `SITE_URL` — Base URL for sitemap generation (default: `https://jeanduplessis.me`)\n   ```\n\n2. Note that `personal.js` component exists but is currently unused/empty\n\n3. Clarify CSP in security headers is intentionally permissive (for compatibility with Vercel insights and Google Fonts)\n\n4. Mention no tsconfig.json/jsconfig.json means relative imports are used throughout\n\n5. Add note: \"No testing framework configured\" if this is intentional\n\n6.

Gotchas about imports and the content-section styling pattern are genuinely useful for future sessions.\n\n```diff\n **Components** (`components/`) — All functional, presentational components with minimal state:\n-- `header.js`, `about.js`, `readme.js`, `career.js`, `contact.js`, `footer.js`, `personal.js`\n - `content-section.js` — Shared layout wrapper for content areas\n+- One component per page section (header, about, career, contact, etc.)\n```\n\n**Update 2: Add environment variable**\n\nWhy: `SITE_URL` is used in the build and not obvious from reading code.\n\n```diff\n+## Environment\n+\n+- `SITE_URL` — Override base URL for sitemap generation (default: `https://jeanduplessis.me`)\n```\n\n**Update 3: Add gotchas section**\n\nWhy: Non-obvious patterns that would trip up a future session.\n\n```diff\n+## Gotchas\n+\n+- **Relative imports only** — No jsconfig.json or path aliases; all imports use relative paths (e.g., `../components/header`).\n+- **Content section heading markers** — `content-section.module.css` adds `##`, `###`, `####` prefixes to headings via `::before` pseudo-elements. These are styled markers, not markdown.\n+- **No test framework** — No jest/vitest/playwright configured. `npm run lint` is the only code quality check.\n```\n\nShall I apply these updates?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3391,"cache_read_input_tokens":28260,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":3391},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXzmo6xf6dECJqS5TKui2","type":"assistant","uuid":"de7671d3-3fe0-493a-833c-840315f0e236","timestamp":"2026-02-10T17:21:21.179Z"}
