As you scroll down the page, we should highlight the section that is in view in the main nav

---

Replace "JdP" in top nav with profile picture

---

Remove the profile image from the About section

---

Change the caption of the image in the about section to "From left: Hannah, Jane, Tracy, Grace and Isabella."

---

Show profile picture as part of hero section

---

The quality and color of the profile image doesn't seem good compared to the src

---

Remove Cape Town, South Africa from hero section

---

Replace all instances of " -- " with appropriate grammar

---

So many em dashes in the copy will make it look like AI generated content. Let's fix this

---

Change "just a scenic drive from Cape Town" to "just a short scenic drive from Cape Town"

---

Remove the paragraph: "I am also a keen sports fan and, when the day winds down, you will likely find me unwinding with a game on the PS5. These quieter pursuits balance the intensity that comes with leading engineering teams across multiple time zones."
